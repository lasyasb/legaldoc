AI-Powered Legal Document Verifier – App Development Prompt

Goal:
Create an AI-based web/mobile app that allows users to upload legal documents (contracts, agreements, etc.), scans them using NLP, and provides:

    Summarization – A simplified breakdown of key terms, obligations, and risks.

    Forgery Detection – Checks for inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched signatures, altered clauses).

    Scam/Fraud Alert – Flags suspicious clauses, hidden liabilities, or unfair terms that could lead to legal/financial harm.

Key Features:

    Document Upload & NLP Analysis:

        Supports PDF, DOCX, and scanned images (OCR for text extraction).

        Uses NLP (like BERT, GPT, or Legal-BERT) to extract clauses, parties, dates, and obligations.

    Summarization:

        Generates a bullet-point summary of critical terms (payment deadlines, penalties, termination clauses).

    Forgery Check:

        Compares fonts, formatting anomalies, and signature irregularities.

        Detects if clauses were edited after signing.

    Scam/Fraud Detection:

        Flags high-risk clauses (e.g., unilateral termination, hidden fees, ambiguous liability terms).

        Alerts if the document resembles known scam templates.

    Compliance Check:

        Verifies if the document follows local laws (e.g., GDPR, contract law).

    User-Friendly Report:

        Provides a risk score (Low/Medium/High) and actionable recommendations.

Tech Stack:

    Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask), NLP libraries (spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers).

    Forgery Detection: Computer Vision (OpenCV, Tesseract OCR for scanned docs).

    Database: Firebase/PostgreSQL (to store document patterns for fraud comparison).

    Frontend: React.js/Flutter (for web/mobile).

Expected Output:

    A working prototype where users upload a document and receive:

        A summary.

        Forgery alerts (if any).

        Scam risk assessment (e.g., "High risk: Unbalanced penalty clauses favor the other party").

Example Workflow:

    User uploads a rental agreement.

    AI highlights:

        "Clause 12 allows landlord to increase rent without notice → Potential scam risk."

        "Signature on page 3 shows pixelation → Possible forgery."

    User gets a PDF report with warnings and suggestions.
